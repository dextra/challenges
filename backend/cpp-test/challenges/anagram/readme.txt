- Anagram

An anagram is direct word switch or word play, the result of
rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or
phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. For example,
'heros' is an anagram of 'horse'.

- Expected input:
In the first line, a single integer of size N, representing the amount 
of lines to read, followed by N lines containing two strings separated 
by a space.

- Expected output:
The analysis result telling if the words are anagrams of each other.

- Constraints:
Input: 0 < N

- Sample input:
2

heros is an anagram of horse
mister is not an anagram of meeters
