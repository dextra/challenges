- Diamonds in the sky

One of the known issues of C++ is related to multiple inheritance. The 
developer who wrote this code was not aware of this and wasn't able 
to fix his program. He wanted to register the amount of stars during 
the rare event of a blue night sky, caused by noctilucent clouds, but 
only adapted his previous code to handle this event.

- Expected input:
A single integer of size N, representing the amount of stars in a blue 
night sky.

- Expected output:
The amount of stars seen in the sky.

- Constraints:
Input: 0 < N
Code: The functions 'readInput', 'getAmountOfStars', 'main' and the
    class 'BlueNightSky' must not be changed.

- Sample input:
728

- Sample output:
728

- Test cases:
All the test cases are in the 'tests' folder.
